      <h1 class="title-small">introduction</h1>
      <p>roman-encryption is an encryption system loosely based off of the principle
        of roman numberals. When reading roman numerals, if a smaller value character
        comes before a larger value one, the smaller value is subtracted from the
        total value instead of added. You can read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_notation" target="_blank">here.</a>
      </p>
      <p>This principle drives roman-encryption: an encrypted number takes form of an
        array of numbers. In order to evaluate the array into a single number, the
        numbers are added up in the same fashion as roman numerals: if a number is
        smaller than the number after it, it is subtracted; otherwise, it is added
        to the total.
      </p>
      <p>The security in roman-encryption comes from the addition of another factor:
        a threshold. When evaluating an encrypted array, you first check if a number
        is smaller than the one after it; if it isn't, then you add the number.
        However, if the number is smaller than the one after it, you then check if
        the difference between the number and the following number is greater than
        a defined "threshold." Only if the difference is larger than the threshold,
        will you subtract that number from the total value.
      </p>
      <p>This creates a varying and unpredictable change in the values of evaluated
        arrays. The threshold is used in creating the encrypted array, and without it,
        it is difficult to decrypt the same array. The real difficulty of breaking
        encryption without the threshold is unknown and untested; I am not knowledgable
        enough to perform any such evaluation.
      </p>
      <p>I believe this encryption algorithm is a proof-of-concept for an additional
        layer of security, perhaps for encrypting a key for a different encryption.
        One downside is that encrypted data will increase in size, so the practicality
        of this method is questionable. These same concepts should be applicable
        across number systems of differing bases as well.
